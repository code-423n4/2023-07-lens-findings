Summary:
The LensBaseERC721 contract contains several potential issues that need to be addressed to ensure the correct and secure functionality of the ERC721 Non-Fungible Token implementation.

1. Vulnerability in _mint function:
In the _mint function, the condition to check if the tokenId already exists is not properly enforced. The function allows minting of tokens even if the tokenId already exists, which could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect token ownership. The _exists function should be called to verify if the tokenId exists before proceeding with the minting process.
 
 - Recommendation 

Fix the _mint function to check if the tokenId exists before minting a new token.


2. Missing validation in _transfer function:
In the _transfer function, when transferring a token from one address to another, it does not validate if the from address indeed owns the token (tokenId). The function should verify ownership before transferring the token to prevent unauthorized transfers.


- Recommendation 

Ensure that the _transfer function verifies that the from address owns the token before transferring it.


3. Inconsistent Error Handling:
Throughout the contract, there are several instances where revert is used to raise exceptions. However, it would be more consistent and informative to use require statements with custom error messages from the Errors library. This way, users and developers can have better insights into why a particular operation failed.

- Recommendation 
Replace revert statements with require statements with custom error messages from the Errors library for better error handling.

4. Lack of Access Control:
The contract lacks access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to specific roles. For instance, functions like burn and approve should only be callable by the token owner or an approved operator. Implementing access control will enhance the security of the contract and prevent unauthorized operations.

- Recommendation 

Implement access control mechanisms to restrict sensitive functions to specific roles (e.g., burn, approve).
