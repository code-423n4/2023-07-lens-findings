Advanced Analysis

Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings:
I found Dangerous use of uninitialized storage variables.

Approach taken in evaluating the codebase:
1. Use Mythx to search for bugs.
2. Once medium or high bug found then write a POC for it.
3. Then submit.

Architecture recommendations:
Utilize AI more.

Codebase quality analysis:
I like the use of apostrophes instead of quotes.
There are a lot of floating pragmas.

Centralization risks:
When buying avoid monopoly by capping individual limits as a percentage, but over time the limit can increase as subscriber base increases.

Mechanism review:
Most of the code files seem secure enough.  
But mostly, the issues are not a concern, such as floating pragmas and state variables not visible.

Systemic risks:
I do not see a risk of an overall structure breakdown. 
Just the odd dangerous use of uninitialized storage variables.
